# 7 Segment

Plain simple 7-segment clock

This is a free clock made wit Open Source and free-to-use code.
It's available here: https://github.com/SergioMorchon/fitbit-7-segment-watch
Most of the code I publish is for learning purposes, and that's the reason behind it being public is to learn together.
You can see other projects I support and that helps other Fitbit developers build great things for you: https://github.com/SergioMorchon?tab=repositories&q=fitbit
